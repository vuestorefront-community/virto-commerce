# Vue Storefront Next VirtoCommerce Integration

> **Disclaimer:** This project is still in beta phase.


* [Documentation]() (WIP)
* [Demo]() (WIP)


This repository is a monorepo containing three projects:

* **api-client** - communicates with a backend;
* **composables** - exposes composable functions used to retrieve data using `api-client` and to map them to universal data formats using `getters`;
* **theme** - `nuxt` project that glues everything together. It extends our core theme and uses `composables` to retrieve data.


The integration is already configured to work with VirtoCommerce live demo site https://demo.virtocommerce.com.

## How to start?

1. Open  theme/nuxt.config.js 
2. Change this line, set the uri where is your Virto platform is running
```JS
//Set with the url where target VC platform is running. 
//The VSF/next application plays a reverse-proxy for all incoming graphql requests and proxy to specified url where vc platform is running.
//This is mandatory to avoid CORS issues and for more flexible  routing settings for VC platform endpoints.
const vcUpstreamEndpointUri = "https://admin-demo.virtocommerce.com";
```
   
3. Install all required dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

3. (optional) Then you can verify if everything works properly by building all three projects:

```sh
yarn build
```

4. If everything built properly, you can start creating your new integration with:

```sh
yarn dev
```
